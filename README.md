# duelergameonline
Temp name for .NET/MVC project. Attempt to create a text-based character developer for dueling vs other players through a website using MVC as best I can.

This is my attempt to create a personal website showcasing my use of MVC.
The code as is now, complies to MVC as best I can, but in the process of trying to get things working some things are not as some of the guides I have watched would suggest. Currently, there is too much info in my controller. I am breaking that down into multiple more specific controllers as I go. Additionally, some of my naming conventions are not as specific or direct as they should be, and those will be corrected as I move along as well.
